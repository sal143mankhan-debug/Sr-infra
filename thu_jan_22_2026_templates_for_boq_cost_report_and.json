Workshop Bulandshahr. Covers measurement capture, verification, sign-off, and data entry to cost reports.\n\nRoles & Responsibilities\n- Site Engineer: Measure, prepare measurement sheets, attach supporting evidence (photos, level notes).\n- QA/QC Engineer: Verify measurements on site, cross-check dimensions against drawings.\n- Quantity Surveyor (QS): Verify calculations, apply rates from Master BOQ, prepare bill.\n- Project Manager / Contract Manager: Approve certified measurements for payment.\n- Accounts: Process payments only against approved measurement records.\n\nProcedure\n1. Measurement Capture (in field)\n   - Use calibrated instruments (tape / total station / laser level) as appropriate.\n   - Record measurement date, location, reference drawing mark/grid, and measured personnel name.\n   - Take at least two photos showing scale/proximity and tag with date/time. If possible, include person in photo for traceability.\n\n2. Measurement Sheet Preparation\n   - Use standard format: Project / Location / Grid / Item Code / Description / Unit / Quantity / Method of Measurement / Remarks.\n   - Reference drawing revision and sheet number.\n\n3. First Check (Site Engineer)\n   - Sign and date the measurement sheet.\n   - Attach photos and any calculation helper sheets (sketches, area calculations).\n\n4. Verification (QA/QC / QS)\n   - Independently verify a sample (minimum 10% of items, or all items above ₹[threshold]) on site.\n   - Re-measure critical dimensions and confirm quantities.\n   - QS to re-calculate quantities and cross-check unit rates against Master BOQ.\n\n5. Certification & Approval\n   - QS prepares the bill for the month and marks \"Verified\".\n   - Project Manager reviews and signs off. For variations beyond [threshold %, e.g., 5%] or > ₹[amount], Contract Manager / Client approval required.\n\n6. Data Entry & Archive\n   - Enter verified quantities into the Monthly Cost Report CSV and Master BOQ as required.\n   - Archive scanned measurement sheets, photos, and sign-off forms in the project document folder. Maintain a naming convention: YYYYMMDD_ItemCode_Location.pdf / .jpg.\n\n7. Dispute / Re-measurement\n   - If client or third-party queries quantity, schedule a re-measurement within 7 days.\n   - Record re-measurement results and attach with resolution notes.\n\nChecklist (before approving a measurement)\n- [ ] Measurement sheet complete and legible\n- [ ] Instruments used noted and calibrated status confirmed\n- [ ] Photos attached and timestamped\n- [ ] QS verification completed (recalculated)\n- [ ] Signatures: Site Engineer, QS, Project Manager\n- [ ] Supporting docs attached (drawing references, calculations)\n- [ ] Variation referenced if measurement differs from BOQ and approved\n\nAcceptance & Records\n- Keep original signed copies and scanned backups.\n- Retain records for the duration required by contract and local regulations (recommendation: minimum 7 years).\n\nRevision History\n- Version 1.0 — 2026-01-22 — Initial SOP for measurement verification\n````\n\nIf you'd like:\n- I can generate an XLSX version of the Master BOQ and Variation Log (zipped) and attach it.\n- I can populate more rows in the BOQ using additional files from the repo (if you provide them or allow me to scan the repo).\n- I can produce a printable monthly report (Markdown → PDF) with the sample numbers shown.",

      "content": "Thanks — I started by loading the repository search ability and attempted to scan the repo for additional BOQ/rate files, but the repository search call failed (repo inaccessible from my search attempt). I can proceed two ways:\n\n- I can scan the repository now if you explicitly permit me to access/scan sal143mankhan-debug/Sr-infra (or make sure the repo/files are accessible). If you grant permission I’ll run a repo search and extract BOQ/quantity/rate lines and populate the Master BOQ automatically.\n- Or I can continue immediately by expanding the Master BOQ using the README data plus typical BOQ line-items for this kind of workshop building (I’ve prepared an expanded BOQ CSV below). You can then supply any repo files later or let me re-scan when you grant access.\n\nTell me which you prefer. If you choose repo scan, reply “Yes — scan the repo” (or provide the specific files to upload).

You have two powerful search tools available: **semantic-code-search** and **lexical-code-search**. Understanding when and how to use each is critical for effective code exploration.\n\n## Available Search Tools\n\n### semantic-code-search\n**What it does:** Understands the meaning and context of your query to find conceptually relevant code.\n\n**When to use:**\n- User asks conceptual questions: \"How does X work?\", \"Where is Y implemented?\"\n- Exploring unfamiliar codebases to understand architecture or features\n- Finding code related to a specific functionality or concept\n- No specific symbol names or file paths are known\n- Need to understand patterns or approaches used in the codebase\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Requires: query (full sentence), repoOwner, repoName\n- Query MUST be a complete sentence describing what you're looking for\n- Returns code snippets ranked by semantic relevance\n- Repository-scoped only (one repo at a time)\n\n**Examples:**\n| User question | Tool call |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| \"How does authentication work in owner/repo?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"How does authentication work?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n| \"Where is rate limiting implemented?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"Where is rate limiting implemented?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n| \"How are database errors handled?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"How are database connection errors handled?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n\n### lexical-code-search\n**What it does:** Performs exact pattern matching using qualifiers to find specific code elements.\n\n**When to use:**\n- User mentions specific symbols, functions, or class names\n- Looking for EXACT text matches (error messages, specific strings)\n- Need to find files by path or name patterns\n- Searching across multiple repositories or organizations\n- User provides EXACT code snippets to find\n- Following up on semantic search to find exact definitions\n\n**Key qualifiers:**\n| Qualifier | Purpose | Example |\n|-----------|---------|---------|\n| symbol: | Find function/class/method definitions | symbol:AuthService |\n| content: | Match exact text in files | content:\"error code 500\" |\n| path: | Match file paths (use regex) | path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/ |\n| repo: | Scope to specific repository | repo:owner/name |\n| org: | Scope to organization | org:github |\n| language: | Filter by programming language | language:python |\n| is: | Filter by properties | is:archived, is:fork, is:vendored, is:generated |\n\n**Symbol construction:**\n\nUse symbol: when users ask about function, class, or method definitions.\n\nCommon patterns:\n| User asks | Interpretation | Tool call |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------|\n| \"Where is class Helper defined in monalisa/net?\" | Looking for class definition | query=\"symbol:Helper\", scopingQuery=\"repo:monalisa/net\" |\n| \"What functions are in Foo.go?\" | Looking for symbols in file | query=\"symbol:Foo\" |\n| \"Describe the method MyFunc\" | Looking for method definition | query=\"symbol:MyFunc\" |\n| \"Find AuthService class\" | Looking for class definition | query=\"symbol:AuthService\" |\n| \"Where is authenticate function?\" | Looking for function definition | query=\"symbol:authenticate\" |\n\n**Boolean operators:** Use OR, NOT, AND to combine conditions\n- Example: symbol:authenticate NOT is:archived\n\n**Parameters:**\n- query: The search query with qualifiers\n- scopingQuery: (optional) Additional scoping like repo:, org:, path:, language:\n\n**Constructing path queries:**\n\nWhen users ask for files in specific directories or with certain names, construct regex paths:\n\nStep-by-step process:\n1. Identify the directory: e.g., \"src/utils/data\"\n2. Add filename pattern: \"src/utils/data/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n3. Escape forward slashes: \"src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n4. Add start anchor: \"^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n5. Wrap in slashes: \"/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n6. Use in query: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n\nCommon patterns:\n- Any file with \"helper\" anywhere: path:/.*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\n- Specific directory, any file: path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*$/\n- File with extension: path:/.*\\\\.test\\\\.js$/\n\n**Examples:**\n| User question | Tool call |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| \"Find the PaymentService class definition\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:PaymentService\" |\n| \"Show me all files with 'helper' in src/utils/\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\" |\n| \"Find error message 'connection timeout'\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"content:\\\"connection timeout\\\"\" |\n| \"Where is authenticate function in owner/repo?\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:authenticate\", scopingQuery=\"repo:owner/repo\" |\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Example 1: Understanding a Feature\nUser: \"How does payment processing work in owner/myapp?\"\n\n1. semantic-code-search: query=\"How does payment processing work?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"myapp\"\n   → Discovers: PaymentService, StripeClient, processPayment function\n2. lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:PaymentService\", scopingQuery=\"repo:owner/myapp\"\n   → Finds exact class definition location\n3. Read the file to understand implementation details\n\n### Example 2: Finding Specific Code\nUser: \"Where is the authenticate function defined?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:authenticate\"\n   → Finds exact definition immediately\n\n### Example 3: Debugging from Error Message\nUser: \"I'm seeing 'database connection timeout' error, where does this come from?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"content:\\\"database connection timeout\\\"\"\n   → Finds where error message is defined\n2. Read surrounding code for context\n\n### Example 4: Exploring a Directory\nUser: \"What helper utilities are in src/utils?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n   → Lists all files with \"helper\" in that directory\n\n## Remember\n\n- **semantic-code-search** = Understanding concepts and architecture (requires full sentences, repoOwner, repoName)\n- **lexical-code-search** = Finding exact symbols, patterns, and text (use qualifiers: symbol:, content:, path:)\n- Use them together: semantic for exploration, lexical for precision\n- Always provide complete, properly formatted queries\n"

Understanding when and how to use each is critical for effective code exploration.\n\n## Available Search Tools\n\n### semantic-code-search\n**What it does:** Understands the meaning and context of your query to find conceptually relevant code.\n\n**When to use:**\n- User asks conceptual questions: \"How does X work?\", \"Where is Y implemented?\"\n- Exploring unfamiliar codebases to understand architecture or features\n- Finding code related to a specific functionality or concept\n- No specific symbol names or file paths are known\n- Need to understand patterns or approaches used in the codebase\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Requires: query (full sentence), repoOwner, repoName\n- Query MUST be a complete sentence describing what you're looking for\n- Returns code snippets ranked by semantic relevance\n- Repository-scoped only (one repo at a time)\n\n**Examples:**\n| User question | Tool call |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| \"How does authentication work in owner/repo?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"How does authentication work?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n| \"Where is rate limiting implemented?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"Where is rate limiting implemented?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n| \"How are database errors handled?\" | semantic-code-search: query=\"How are database connection errors handled?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"repo\" |\n\n### lexical-code-search\n**What it does:** Performs exact pattern matching using qualifiers to find specific code elements.\n\n**When to use:**\n- User mentions specific symbols, functions, or class names\n- Looking for EXACT text matches (error messages, specific strings)\n- Need to find files by path or name patterns\n- Searching across multiple repositories or organizations\n- User provides EXACT code snippets to find\n- Following up on semantic search to find exact definitions\n\n**Key qualifiers:**\n| Qualifier | Purpose | Example |\n|-----------|---------|---------|\n| symbol: | Find function/class/method definitions | symbol:AuthService |\n| content: | Match exact text in files | content:\"error code 500\" |\n| path: | Match file paths (use regex) | path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/ |\n| repo: | Scope to specific repository | repo:owner/name |\n| org: | Scope to organization | org:github |\n| language: | Filter by programming language | language:python |\n| is: | Filter by properties | is:archived, is:fork, is:vendored, is:generated |\n\n**Symbol construction:**\n\nUse symbol: when users ask about function, class, or method definitions.\n\nCommon patterns:\n| User asks | Interpretation | Tool call |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------|\n| \"Where is class Helper defined in monalisa/net?\" | Looking for class definition | query=\"symbol:Helper\", scopingQuery=\"repo:monalisa/net\" |\n| \"What functions are in Foo.go?\" | Looking for symbols in file | query=\"symbol:Foo\" |\n| \"Describe the method MyFunc\" | Looking for method definition | query=\"symbol:MyFunc\" |\n| \"Find AuthService class\" | Looking for class definition | query=\"symbol:AuthService\" |\n| \"Where is authenticate function?\" | Looking for function definition | query=\"symbol:authenticate\" |\n\n**Boolean operators:** Use OR, NOT, AND to combine conditions\n- Example: symbol:authenticate NOT is:archived\n\n**Parameters:**\n- query: The search query with qualifiers\n- scopingQuery: (optional) Additional scoping like repo:, org:, path:, language:\n\n**Constructing path queries:**\n\nWhen users ask for files in specific directories or with certain names, construct regex paths:\n\nStep-by-step process:\n1. Identify the directory: e.g., \"src/utils/data\"\n2. Add filename pattern: \"src/utils/data/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n3. Escape forward slashes: \"src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n4. Add start anchor: \"^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$\"\n5. Wrap in slashes: \"/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n6. Use in query: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/data\\\\/[^\\\\/]*help[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n\nCommon patterns:\n- Any file with \"helper\" anywhere: path:/.*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\n- Specific directory, any file: path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*$/\n- File with extension: path:/.*\\\\.test\\\\.js$/\n\n**Examples:**\n| User question | Tool call |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| \"Find the PaymentService class definition\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:PaymentService\" |\n| \"Show me all files with 'helper' in src/utils/\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\" |\n| \"Find error message 'connection timeout'\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"content:\\\"connection timeout\\\"\" |\n| \"Where is authenticate function in owner/repo?\" | lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:authenticate\", scopingQuery=\"repo:owner/repo\" |\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Example 1: Understanding a Feature\nUser: \"How does payment processing work in owner/myapp?\"\n\n1. semantic-code-search: query=\"How does payment processing work?\", repoOwner=\"owner\", repoName=\"myapp\"\n   → Discovers: PaymentService, StripeClient, processPayment function\n2. lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:PaymentService\", scopingQuery=\"repo:owner/myapp\"\n   → Finds exact class definition location\n3. Read the file to understand implementation details\n\n### Example 2: Finding Specific Code\nUser: \"Where is the authenticate function defined?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"symbol:authenticate\"\n   → Finds exact definition immediately\n\n### Example 3: Debugging from Error Message\nUser: \"I'm seeing 'database connection timeout' error, where does this come from?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"content:\\\"database connection timeout\\\"\"\n   → Finds where error message is defined\n2. Read surrounding code for context\n\n### Example 4: Exploring a Directory\nUser: \"What helper utilities are in src/utils?\"\n\n1. lexical-code-search: query=\"path:/^src\\\\/utils\\\\/[^\\\\/]*helper[^\\\\/]*$/\"\n   → Lists all files with \"helper\" in that directory\n\n## Remember\n\n- **semantic-code-search** = Understanding concepts and architecture (requires full sentences, repoOwner, repoName)\n- **lexical-code-search** = Finding exact symbols, patterns, and text (use qualifiers: symbol:, content:, path:)\n- Use them together: semantic for exploration, lexical for precision\n- Always provide complete, properly formatted queries\n"

I extracted all rate-analysis lines and structural notes I could find, calculated any quantities that are explicit or directly derivable (e.g., footing volume from the footing dimensions), and populated additional BOQ rows where values are available from the README. Items that require drawings or measurement sheets remain as placeholders and are flagged in the Notes column.\n\nBelow is the populated Master BOQ CSV (extracted from README.md + calculated items).

Workshop Bulandshahr. Covers measurement capture, verification, sign-off, and data entry to cost reports.\n\nRoles & Responsibilities\n- Site Engineer: Measure, prepare measurement sheets, attach supporting evidence (photos, level notes).\n- QA/QC Engineer: Verify measurements on site, cross-check dimensions against drawings.\n- Quantity Surveyor (QS): Verify calculations, apply rates from Master BOQ, prepare bill.\n- Project Manager / Contract Manager: Approve certified measurements for payment.\n- Accounts: Process payments only against approved measurement records.\n\nProcedure\n1. Measurement Capture (in field)\n   - Use calibrated instruments (tape / total station / laser level) as appropriate.\n   - Record measurement date, location, reference drawing mark/grid, and measured personnel name.\n   - Take at least two photos showing scale/proximity and tag with date/time. If possible, include person in photo for traceability.\n\n2. Measurement Sheet Preparation\n   - Use standard format: Project / Location / Grid / Item Code / Description / Unit / Quantity / Method of Measurement / Remarks.\n   - Reference drawing revision and sheet number.\n\n3. First Check (Site Engineer)\n   - Sign and date the measurement sheet.\n   - Attach photos and any calculation helper sheets (sketches, area calculations).\n\n4. Verification (QA/QC / QS)\n   - Independently verify a sample (minimum 10% of items, or all items above ₹[threshold]) on site.\n   - Re-measure critical dimensions and confirm quantities.\n   - QS to re-calculate quantities and cross-check unit rates against Master BOQ.\n\n5. Certification & Approval\n   - QS prepares the bill for the month and marks \"Verified\".\n   - Project Manager reviews and signs off. For variations beyond [threshold %, e.g., 5%] or > ₹[amount], Contract Manager / Client approval required.\n\n6.
